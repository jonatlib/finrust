# Transaction System Documentation

This document provides an overview of the transaction system in the FinRust project, explaining how the different components work together.

## Transaction Model

The core of the transaction system is the `Transaction` struct defined in `model/src/transaction.rs`. This represents a single financial transaction with:

- A date
- An amount (using Decimal for precision)
- An account ID

## Transaction Generation

The `TransactionGenerator` trait defines an interface for types that can generate transactions within a date range:

```
pub trait TransactionGenerator {
    fn has_any_transaction(&self, start: NaiveDate, end: NaiveDate) -> bool;
    fn generate_transactions(&self, start: NaiveDate, end: NaiveDate) -> impl Iterator<Item = Transaction>;
}
```

This trait allows different transaction types (one-off, recurring, imported, etc.) to be treated uniformly when generating transactions for analysis.

## Transaction Processing

The compute workspace provides functionality for working with transactions:

1. Converting transactions to Polars DataFrames for analysis
2. Calculating balances based on transactions
3. Processing recurring transactions
4. Merging results from different calculation methods

## Design Philosophy

The system is designed with the following principles:

1. **Separation of concerns**: Model definitions are in the model workspace, computational logic is in the compute workspace
2. **Abstraction**: Different transaction types implement common traits to allow uniform processing
3. **Extensibility**: New transaction types can be added by implementing the required traits

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for improvement:

1. Add support for more transaction attributes (categories, descriptions, etc.)
2. Implement more sophisticated recurring transaction patterns
3. Add transaction validation and error handling
4. Improve performance for large transaction sets
