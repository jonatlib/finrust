# Data Migration Documentation

This document provides an overview of the data migration system in the FinRust project.

## Purpose

The migration workspace is responsible for:

1. Defining migration scripts for database schema changes
2. Providing utilities for data transformation during migrations
3. Managing the migration process to ensure data integrity

## Migration Process

The migration process typically involves:

1. **Planning**: Identifying the changes needed to the data model
2. **Script Creation**: Writing migration scripts to transform data
3. **Testing**: Verifying migrations work correctly on test data
4. **Execution**: Running migrations on production data
5. **Verification**: Ensuring data integrity after migration

## Best Practices

When creating new migrations:

1. Always create a backup before running migrations
2. Make migrations idempotent when possible (can be run multiple times without side effects)
3. Include both up and down migrations for reversibility
4. Test migrations thoroughly on representative test data
5. Document the purpose and effects of each migration

## Integration with Other Components

The migration system interacts with:

1. **Model Workspace**: Uses the data models defined in the model workspace
2. **Compute Workspace**: May use computation utilities for data transformations

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for improvement:

1. Automated migration testing framework
2. Migration dependency management
3. Performance optimizations for large datasets
4. Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
